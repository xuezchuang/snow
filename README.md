# 3D-Game-Engine
> This is a C++ based 3D Game Engine that is NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT. Currently the idea and gamplay of this project is yet to be decided, but some features have already been implemented including:

1. Input management - Mouse and keyboard including modifiers and all key states
2. Sound management - 3D and 2D audio. Including audio listeners, SFX and music
3. Simple graphics - Drawing an array of vertices
4. Shaders - Support for any type of GLSL shader
5. OBJ File Loading - For custom 3D models
6. Camera management
7. GameObjects
8. UV Mapping
9. Textures
10. A Math class
11. Perlin Noise - For procedural generation
12. Physics
13. Collision Detection 
14. Rigidbodies

The following dependencies are used:

1. `GLFW` - For creating the window and handling OS-specific operations
2. `GLEW` - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler
3. `OpenGL` - Allows for drawing of graphics via the GPU
4. `AmBIERA irrKlang` - For 3D and 2D audio managment
5. `SOIL` - For loading images as textures
6. `libnoise` - For perlin noise
7. `Bullet` - For physics, collision detection and rigidbodies
